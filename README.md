## Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending. Different sorting techniques vary in terms of efficiency, stability, and space complexity.
| Sorting Algorithm        | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity | Stable? |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Selection Sort**      | O(nÂ²)      | O(nÂ²)       | O(nÂ²)      | O(1)            |  No  |
| **Bubble Sort**         | O(n)       | O(nÂ²)       | O(nÂ²)      | O(1)            |  Yes |
| **Insertion Sort**      | O(n)       | O(nÂ²)       | O(nÂ²)      | O(1)            |  Yes |
| **Merge Sort**          | O(n log n) | O(n log n)  | O(n log n) | O(n)            |  Yes |
| **Quick Sort**          | O(n log n) | O(n log n)  | O(nÂ²)      | O(log n)        |  No  |
| **Iterative Quick Sort**| O(n log n) | O(n log n)  | O(nÂ²)      | O(log n)        |  No  |
- ### Selection Sort
 :Finds the minimum element and places it at the beginning, repeating the process for the rest of the list.

- ### Bubble Sort (`bubblesort.cpp`)
:Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

- ### Insertion Sort (`insertionsort.cpp`)
:Inserts each element at the correct position in the sorted part of the array.

- ### Merge Sort
:  Uses the divide-and-conquer approach by recursively splitting the array and merging sorted halves.

##  Mathematical & Miscellaneous Algorithms
These algorithms solve various computational problems.

### ðŸ”¹ Find Peak Element in 1D & 2D Array
- Finding an element which is >= to its neighbours
- **1D**
Implemented using algo similar to Binary Search
- **2D**
Implemented using algo similar to Binary Search but works in a 2D array
- **Used in optimization problems** to find local maxima.
- Efficiently finds peaks in **logarithmic time**.

### ðŸ”¹ Magic Square (`magicsquare.cpp`)
- A square matrix where the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same.
- Follows a set pattern in where the numbers increase in a diagonal upwards to the left and goes down one when number is a multiple of the size
- **Used in cryptography and mathematical puzzles.**

### ðŸ”¹ Cosine Similarity (`cosinsimilarity.cpp`)
- Measures similarity between two non-zero vectors.
- Each files words are treated like a vector and the angle between the vectors created from the two file give the value for cosQ which tells us the similarity between the files
- **Used in recommendation systems and NLP.**

### ðŸ”¹ Jaccard Similarity (`jaccard.cpp`)
- Measures similarity between two sets.
- **Used in machine learning and clustering.**

##  Divide And Conquer Algorithms
These algorithms **break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine the results.**

### ðŸ”¹ Binary Search (`binarysearch.cpp`)
- Searches for an element in a sorted array in **O(log n) time**.
- **Much faster than linear search** for large datasets.

### ðŸ”¹ Max-Min Problem (`maxmin.cpp`)
- Finds the maximum and minimum in an array using **divide and conquer**.
- More efficient than brute force approaches.

### ðŸ”¹ Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
**Conventional Method
Using divide and conquer to break the matrix into smaller parts and multiplying them to get the resulting martix**
- Strassen's is  fast matrix multiplication algorithm.
- **Reduces multiplication complexity from O(nÂ³) to O(n^2.81).**

## Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step **without considering future consequences**.

### ðŸ”¹ Activity Selection (`activitysel.cpp`)
- Selects the **maximum number of activities** that donâ€™t overlap.
- **Used in scheduling problems.**

### ðŸ”¹ Knapsack Problem (`knapsack.cpp`)
- Optimizes item selection to **maximize value** within a weight constraint.
- We sort the array according to the metric we need(here we sort 3 time, according to profit, weight and ratio of profit/weight) and then pick the items in non-increasing manner
- The fractional part allows us to pick out items in fraction
For example if we have a capacity of 10 and the item weights 20 we can take out 10 out the weight instead of leaving that item and going to the next
- **Used in resource allocation problems.**

- **Used in network routing and GPS systems.**

### ðŸ”¹ Primâ€™s Algorithm
